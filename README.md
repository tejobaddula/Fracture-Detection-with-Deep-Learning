# Fracture-Detection-with-Deep-Learning
Utilized deep learning for X-ray image analysis, comprising a "Body Part Identification Model" (ResNet-50) achieving 97.11% accuracy in identifying body regions. Implemented a "Fracture Detection Model" with more than 95% accuracy for different body parts. Employed TensorFlow, Keras for training, and matplotlib for visualization.
